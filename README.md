## Course Description

This course is intended to be an introductory survey on the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie current and emerging methods, tools, and techniques for the efficient engineering of high-quality software systems. This may include the understanding and appreciation of problems in large-scale software development such as functional analysis of information processing systems, system design concepts, timing estimates, documentation and system testing. 

Software Engineering (SE) is concerned with all facets of software development, from the early stages of requirements engineering to maintaining the system after it has been deployed. This includes technical processes of software development as well as activities such as software project management and the development of tools, methods, and theories to support software development. This course is not a "programming" course per se, instead, it focuses on surveying some of the critical facets of SE that may be less familiar to students of Computer Science, such as identifying a development process appropriate to the circumstances, eliciting and documenting requirements, using reviews and inspections plus machine-based testing in software development, understanding software evolution in large, complex systems, issues associated with developing dependable software systems, and configuration management of large systems developed by multiple engineers.

## Credit/No Credit Policy & Special Enrollment Permission

The instructor will not approve credit/no credit requests for this course. However, such requests may be approved by the college on a per-semester basis; students are encouraged to check the college policies. Students are also encouraged to discuss these options with their academic advisor. Special enrollment permissions, e.g., prerequisite waivers, will not be granted without substantial supporting evidence, e.g., sufficient professional experience.

## Organization

### Lectures

The first hour of each class session will include a lecture on the day's topic.

### Lab

The remaining time in each class session will be devoted to lab work, where students will work together with their lab partners on a semester-long project.

### Homework

Homework will be assigned after each chapter read. It may include questions at the end of the chapter and/or short coding assignments depending on the material. Each will be assigned in Blackboard along with submission instructions. I have designed this course to be **self-contained**. Thus, **the only resources you need to answer the questions are contained within the course**. Searching the web (e.g., Google) for answers is not only *unnecessary* but also risks [academic violations](#academic-violations), which can result in course failure.

### Project

Students will work together in assigned groups on a semester-long project. The project must incorporate the lessons learned from the week's topic. Thus, the project will be done incrementally throughout the semester. However, the project will require the following *each and every week*:

1. A working prototype of the project. This can be as simple as a project skeleton. Be prepared to "throw away" the prototype each week for the first few weeks as your knowledge of the course progresses.
1. Code hosted on our GitHub Classroom.
1. Working tests invoked via continuous integration (CI).

Please inform the instructor if your group requires any computing resources from the Computer Science department to complete your project.

### Presentation

A select number of groups may be asked to present their final projects towards the end of the semester.

### Notes

- **Deadlines** and **due dates** for assignments will be assigned in class.
- **Late assignments will be penalized.**
- No extensions will be given for extra credit assignments.
- Assignments are the result of **individual effort** unless otherwise noted (e.g., group projects).

### Exams

Test make-ups will be given if and only if:

- the request is made sufficiently in advance of the test, and
- the make-up is scheduled prior to the next class.

Proctoring software, which may include the use of browser lock-downs and cameras, may be used for examinations in this course.

## Class Meetings

### Meeting Mechanism

Our class will meet online (synchronous) during the registrar-allocated meeting time. We will be using Bb Collaborate Ultra.

### Attendance

Attendance is expected for *each and every class* meeting. The instructor will start the class on time, and students are expected to be present on time.

### Professional Presence & Communication

A central focus of this course is to simulate the professional work environment of Software Engineers. Thus, every student is expected to present themselves in a professional manor, even remotely. Students with questions or who wish to participate during lecture are encouraged to "raise their hands" during the class period on Bb Collaborate Ultra. During the lab period, students are expected to fully (and solely) participate in their group activities under a professional demeanor.

### Video & Audio Expectations

Please be aware that the instructor in this course will require that the camera be on and audio be available during class sessions. Students that do not have cameras may [borrow a laptop][loan]. Students without microphones may call into the class sessions.

### Recording Policy

Please be advised that students who participate in this class with their camera on or use a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded solely for the purpose of creating a record for students enrolled in the class to refer to, including those enrolled students who are unable to attend live. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded. If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the "chat" feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live.

## Academic Violations

Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The college is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures. Special attention is given to CONTRACT CHEATING (this is where students have work completed on their behalf which is then submitted for academic credit). Academic violations will be pursued to the fullest extent possible, including failure from the course.

## Email

- Emails to the instructor must be via a CUNY email addresses for FERPA reasons.
- Include the *class name* or *number* in the *subject* line of the email.
- Email thread *hijacking* is strongly discouraged. Ensure that the subject of your email matches its contents.
- Post all class-related discussion on the Bb discussion board.
- Ensure that your *correct* email address is entered into the CUNY Blackboard.

## Bulletin Board

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "eligible students."

- Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.
- Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.
- Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR § 99.31):
    - School officials with legitimate educational interest;
    - Other schools to which a student is transferring;
    - Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;
    - Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;
    - Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;
    - Accrediting organizations;
    - To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; 
    - Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and
    - State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law.

Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper article) is left to the discretion of each school.
